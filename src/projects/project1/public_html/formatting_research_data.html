		<h1>How to organize and analyze research data</h1>
		<aside>
			For this lesson, you'll need the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Microsoft Excel</li>
				<li>PASW (formerly SPSS) statistics software, or free trial download</li>
			</ul>
			You should already be familiar with:
			<ul>
				<li>The basic functions and tools of Excel</li>
				<li><strong>Descriptive statistics</strong> and <strong>inferential statistics</strong></li>
				<li>Research design and how to identify independent variables and dependent variables</li>
			</ul>
		</aside>
		<p>
			This short lesson is intended for graduate and advanced undergraduate students undertaking original research projects.
			After completing the 30-minute lesson, you will be able to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis</li>
			<li>Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel</li>
			<li>Prepare the document for statistical analysis in the software package PASW</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Format data for analysis</h1>
		<p>
			Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel installed.
			Open the document <a href="/files/tutorial_spreadsheet.xlsx">ToolBox_DataLesson.xls</a> in Excel and follow along with the lesson, taking action as instructed.
			In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name of each variance has been entered in the first row of each column.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Each variable name must be different from other variable names.</li>
			<li>The first variable (in column A) is a <strong>unique identifier</strong>.</li>
			<li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters), so change <code>4tutorial_types</code> to <code>tutorial_types</code>.</li>
			<li>
				Name variables so that they are intuitive to you.
				Therefore, change <code>use</code> and <code>useful</code> to <code>perc_ease_of_use</code> and <code>perc_usefulness</code>, respectively.
			</li>
			<li>Your spreadsheet should look like <a href="#column_names">Figure 1</a>, and it should now be readily apparent that Column F refers to <code>Perceived Usefulness</code> and Column G refers to <code>Perceived Ease of Use</code>.</li>
		</ol>
		<figure id="column_names">
			<img src="/images/datalesson_fig3.png" alt="An overview of the spreadsheet with the changed names for Column F and Column G.">
			<figcaption>Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorical values have been formatted as dichotomous variables.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>Data values, or rows, have been inputted for each subject in the experiment.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Decide on input conventions and stick to them.
				In <code>gender</code>, change the "female" value to "F".
			</li>
			<li>
				Separate data into component values whenever possible by adding new columns.
				For example, <code>tasks_completed</code> values (Y/Y/N) can be broken up into three components.
				So, add columns <code>task1</code>, <code>task2</code>, and <code>task3</code>, and reformat values appropriately.
			</li>
			<li>Double-check to ensure no data entry errors have been made, then delete the old <code>tasks_completed</code> column.</li>
			<li>Your <code>Raw_Dataset</code> spreadsheet should now look life <a href="#tasks">Figure 2</a>.</li>
		</ol>
		<figure id="tasks">
			<img src="/images/datalesson_fig2.png" alt="An overview of the spreadsheet with the tasks_completed column into three columns.">
			<figcaption>Values for each variable are entered in a consistent format.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Replace categorical data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) to indicate whether or not the value is represented for the given subject/item.
			This makes the categorical values <strong>dichotomous</strong>, which gives the researcher maximum flexibility in testing for relationships or correlations.
		</p>
		<aside>
			Dichotomous variables allow for the easy isolation of characteristics for analysis.
			For example, separating <i>experience</i> levels allows the researcher to test in PASW whether subjects with low experience have <i>perceived ease of use</i> scores significantly different from those with medium and high experience levels.
		</aside>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Copy the Raw_Dataset values into the Sheet2 tab.
				Rename this sheet Formatted_Data.
			</li>
			<li>
				In the Formatted_Data sheet, add new columns with <b>Insert > Columns</b> for each distinct value in categorical data columns (<code>tutorial_types</code>, <code>gender</code>, <code>exp_level</code>, <code>task1</code>, <code>task1</code>, and <code>task3</code>).
				You do not have to add a new column for <code>task1</code>, <code>task1</code>, and <code>task3</code> because their values from the original column.
			</li>
			<li>
				Rename columns according to each possible categorical value.
				Copy and paste the values from the original column.
			</li>
			<li>Replace dichotomous data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) using the replace function: <b>Edit > Replace</b>.</li>
			<li>Your Formatted_Data spreadsheet should now look like <a href="#replacements">Figure 3</a>.</li>

		<h1>Run descriptive statistics</h1>
		<aside>
			Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions.
			For example, <code>perc_enjoy</code> is must higher on average that <code>perc_usefulness</code>, which also has a large variance.
			This suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the system useful even though they enjoyed using it.
		</aside>
		<p>
			Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet.
			If necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, those with <strong>continuous</strong> values, are adjacent.
			(In the spreadsheet, the continuous values of <i>perc_enjoy</i>, <i>perc_usefulness</i>, and <i>perc_ease_of_use</i> are already adjacent.)<br>
			Write down the "input" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary, making sure not to include variable labels.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Go to <b>Tools > Add-Ins...</b> and make sure <b>Analysis ToolPak</b> is checked. Click OK.</li>
			<li>Go to <b>Tools > Data Analysis</b> select <b>Descriptive Statistics</b>. Click OK.</li>
			<li>Enter the input range in the blank and check <b>Summary Statistics</b>. Click OK.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet.
			Rename this spreadsheet Descriptive_Stats.
			Label the output according to the variables.
			For example, <i>Column 1</i> should be <code>perc_enjoy</code>.
			Your Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet should now look like <a href="#descriptive_stats">Figure 4</a>.
			Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising a dataset before running inferential statistics.
			What insights about the dataset can you glean from the summary statistics for <code>perc_usefulness</code> and <code>perc_ease_of_use</code>?
		</p>

			<img src="/images/datalesson_fig4.png" alt="An overview of the spreadsheet with descriptive statistics.">
			<figcaption>EXCEL will not run descriptive statistics with non-numeric characters, so the variable labels must be re-entered.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<h1>Run inferential statistics</h1>
		<p>
			Open PASW and upload the spreadsheet.
			(IIT labs in Stuart Building, room 112, have PASW.
			You can also download a 30-day free trial.)
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				When PASW starts, it will prompt you for a data source.
				Select <b>Open an existing data source > More files...</b>
			</li>
			<li>Set the file type to Excel, then find and open the file.</li>
			<li>
				From the list, select the Formatted_Data worksheet.
				Click OK.
				You should now see the dataset.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The most commonly used statistical methods and tests are found under the <b>Analyze</b> menu in the standard toolbar.</p>
		<p>
			<a href="#menu">Figure 5</a> shows where to find some common statistical methods and tests.
			Under PASW's <b>Analyze</b> menu, see if you can also find the following:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test</li>
			<li>Simple linear regression</li>
			<li>Non-parametric correlation</li>
		</ol>
		<figure id="menu">
			<img src="/images/datalesson_fig5.png" alt="">
			<figcaption>
				Don't assume PASW doesn't run a given test.
				Many are located under broader statistical classifications.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>Use your prior knowledge or the <a href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/default.htm">Choosing the Correct Statistic</a> resource to determine which statistic to run to find whether there is a significant difference in <code>perc_usefulness</code> between <code>free_play</code> and other tutorial types.</p>
		<aside>Consult <a href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/default.htm">UCLA's Choosing the Correct Statistic</a> to ensure the statistical analysis is appropriate for you research question(s), variables of interest, and associated data types.</aside>
		<p>
			You should be determined that the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance is the appropriate test.
			Go to <b>Analyze > Nonparametric Tests > K Independent Samples...</b>
			A new window will open prompting you to select the variables (by column name) to be tested.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Select the <code>perc_usefulness</code> variable from the scrollable list on the left, and click the top arrow to move it to the Test Variable List (i.e. dependent variable).</li>
			<li>Select the <code>free_play</code> variable from the scrollable list, and click the bottom arrow to move it to the Grouping Variable section (i.e. independent variable).</li>
			<li>
				Click <b>Define Range...</b>, and enter "0" in the Minimum field and "1" in the Maximum field.
				This specifies the two categorical variables to be tested.
				Your screen should now look like <a href="#samples">Figure 6</a>.
				Click Continue.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<figure id="samples">
